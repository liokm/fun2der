# fun2der, Fun Funder or Funder having Fun [Unfinished]

The project is a simple fundraising service. 
People can input project info and start token-based crowdsale per project. 
Funders can invest on small amount of crowdsale each time instead of a huge crowdsale without any further audit and participation, just like what DAICO provides.

The contract fils is Fun2der.sol, and the frontend for now only has 
- login
- current account info
- functionality to create sample Project and show products count

```
npm i
# Start local eth network, then 
truffle compile
truffle migrate
npm start
```
